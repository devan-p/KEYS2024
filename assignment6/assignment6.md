### Title:
Developing, Implementing, and Testing Reproducible AI Chatbots in Research and Educational Applications

### Short Abstract:
AI is transforming our world at an unprecedented rate. My project focused on developing a ChatGPT-4o based assistant with research and educational applications. This chatbot access files from a source to update its knowledge at a set interval. Currently the chatbot is being deployed on CyVerse Data Commons, a platform where researchers around the world store their data. The chatbot aims to help curious individuals better comprehend complex datasets. To ensure all responses are accurate, this assistant cites all referenced material via hyperlinks to specific web pages where data is stored. This will help researchers streamline their analysis process by providing accurate data driven insights.
