## Assignment 2: Research Introduction

### Purpose & Prior Research: 

Researchers often deal with large and complicated datasets which are difficult to interpret and work with. The purpose of my project, creating an AI chatbot trained on researcher’s data, will help researchers identify complex patterns, provide an analysis, and answer data-related questions accurately. This directly contributes to CyVerse’s mission of providing powerful computational infrastructure to researchers. Embedding AI chatbots into websites to answer questions is fairly common, however, it is uncommon to see this model applied to a research setting at this scale. 

### Need For Study Problem Statement: 

The stereotypical definition of research is collecting information. However, analyzing their data is a time consuming process and is just as important. My project – developing an AI chatbot trained on researcher’s datasets and embedded into [CyVerse](https://cyverse.org/){target=_blank} – aims to make intricate datasets readily interpretable and actionable. This will significantly boost researcher’s productivity by eliminating the need to sift through thousands of files and will provide non-researchers with comprehensible data-driven insights about topics they may be unfamiliar with.
