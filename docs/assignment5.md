## Assignment 4: Long Abstract

AI is transforming our world at an unprecedented rate. At the intersection of AI and research, my project focused on developing a custom, reproducible ChatGPT-4o based chatbot with research applications. Aided by ChatGPT and Gemini, I used Javascript, python, html, OpenAIâ€™s API, and a virtual machine to develop, test, and deploy my chatbot. I created open source documentation published on GitHub for others to implement my chatbot. By using a Cron Job and an executable python script, this chatbot can download files from a source to update its knowledge at any set interval. Currently this chatbot is being deployed on CyVerse Data Commons, a platform for researchers around the world to store their data. This will help researchers streamline their analysis process by providing accurate data driven insights. This chatbot will also help curious individuals better comprehend complex datasets. To ensure all responses are accurate, this chatbot cites all referenced material via hyperlinks to specific web pages where data is stored. This chatbot has countless research applications and many more in other industries.
