## Research Goal:

Create an custom ChatGPT 4o chatbot trained on any website. Implement my chatbot on the CyVerse Learning Materials websites

## Introduction

CyVerse is a powerful computational infrastructure for researchers & educators

AI models have grown in popularity, efficiency, and capability with the rise of GPTs and LLMs

Researchers want access to AI chatbots trained on their datasets. These will yield faster, more accurate data-driven insights.

Following Open Science best-practices requires transparency and reproducibility through open source software, versus commercial software, like what OpenAI sells.

Creating detailed documentation helps enhance understanding, collaboration, and reproducibility of scientific research. 

## Discussion

Accuracy is verified by citations and hyperlinks of all sources

Chatbots enable users to quickly receive accurate responses

Each Vector Store (knowledge base) can be automatically updated with current information

Assistant also has access to the entirety of the internet to gather information

Implementation Cost: hosting a Virtual Machine

Running Cost: proportional to amount and size of messages

Message (token) limits are necessary to prevent overspending

ChatGPT streamlines the development process â€“ it helps write code and resolve errors.
